### **Cross-platform agent to backup directories to AmazonS3 object storage** <h6>

We need a free and reliable solution to backup our sensitive data to a safe place.

After researching different solutions and finding free ones, they all depend on our servers and infrastructure. Still, we want to store all data in other cloud servers for fault tolerance and reliability.

We decided to develop a tool to run on all of our servers to backup databases/directories and upload them to the Arvan object storage infrastructure based on AmazonS3, so the solution is compatible with all AmazonS3 services.

I called it hamsters because Hamsters don't just stuff their faces with food -- they can also pack up their cheek pouches with babies. Mother hamsters are protective of their babies, and when they perceive a threat to the newborn clan, she may stuff the babies into her mouth and hide the babies in her cheek ;)

So Hamster was born. She protects all our services from evil!
